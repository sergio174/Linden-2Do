==========

This test was developed using jQuery and Backbone.js

Basic functionality is as follows:

1. User can create tasks.
2. Tasks can be created and then modified as done and/or important.
3. Each task can be created related to an existing or new category.
4. The sidebar has two groups: by status and by category.
5. The user can delete tasks and categories. In the case of the categories, it's possible to reassign the tasks of the category to another one.


Future features

1. Build categories using Backbone models.
2. Build tasks and cats methods using Backbone.
